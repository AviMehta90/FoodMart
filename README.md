## Project Overview
This project is a React Native application with a Node Express.js backend server. It's designed to showcase a simple mobile app with backend functionality. The project includes various assets, source code files, and configuration files to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Expo CLI: Install the Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- Git: You need Git for version control. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- Dependencies: Run `npm install` in the project root to install project dependencies.

## Getting Started
